The script enables a ped menu triggered by the /ped command. When executed, it reads a configuration file containing predefined ped models and settings (e.g., model ID, animations, or skins). The script then applies the selected ped configuration to the player or target, replacing their current model with the specified ped while preserving gameplay functionality. It includes error handling for invalid configs and optional admin permissions to restrict access. The menu can be extended with UI elements for easier ped selection if needed.

## Installation
