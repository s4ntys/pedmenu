### Simple Ped Menu
- A lightweight script for ESX or QBCore frameworks that allows players to change their character model to a predefined ped using the - - /ped command. The ped is assigned based on the player's license, as specified in the configuration file.

### Features

Supports both ESX and QBCore frameworks.
Assigns specific ped models to players based on their license.
Simple /ped command to spawn the configured ped.
Easy-to-configure ped list with license-based permissions.

### Installation

Download the script from the repository.
Extract the files and place the simple-ped-menu folder into your server's resources directory.
Configure the script by editing the config.lua file (see Configuration section below).
Add the resource to your server by adding ensure simple-ped-menu to your server.cfg.
Restart your server or use refresh followed by start simple-ped-menu.

### Configuration


- The config.lua file allows you to set the framework and define permitted peds for specific player licenses.
Example Config
```Config = {}

-- Framework Select ('esx' or 'qbcore')
Config.Framework = 'esx' -- Change to 'qbcore' if you want to use QBCore

-- List of permitted peds by licence
Config.AllowedPeds = {
    ['license:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'] = 'a_c_husky', -- Pes
    ['license:yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy'] = 'a_c_cat_01' -- Maƒçka
}
```


### Config Options

- Config.Framework: Set to 'esx' or 'qbcore' depending on your server's framework.
- Config.AllowedPeds: A table mapping player licenses to ped model names.
Key: The player's license (e.g., license:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx).
Value: The ped model name (e.g., a_c_husky, a_c_cat_01). Use valid ped model names from the game.



### Usage

- Ensure the player's license is added to the Config.AllowedPeds table with a valid ped model.
In-game, use the /ped command to spawn the ped assigned to your license.
The script will replace the player's model with the specified ped while maintaining gameplay functionality.

- Example
If a player with the license license:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx uses /ped, their model will change to a_c_husky (a husky dog).
Notes

- Ensure the ped models specified in Config.AllowedPeds are valid and exist in the game.
Only players with a matching license in the config can use the /ped command successfully.
Developers should verify licenses and ped models to avoid errors.
For a list of valid ped models, refer to the GTA V ped model list.
